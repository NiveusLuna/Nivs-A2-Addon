# Nivs-A2-Addon
 NiveusLuna's Glorious Addon for Star Trek: Armada II Classic

As the name implies, this is an addon modpack. Not for A2, but for the FleetOps
mod "Star Trek: Armada 2 Classic". It is dependent on the FleetOps engine, and
is written for the 4.0 launcher. As the 4.0 launcher fixes several bugs in the
STA2 Classic addon to begin with, I recommend using it.

This mod contains both original work and mods made by others. I have not sought
permission for the mods made by others. This is because most were made over ten
years ago and contacting these people would be a royal pain in the ass. IF YOU
CREATED ONE OF THE INCLUDED MODS AND OBJECT TO MY REDISTRIBUTION THEREOF AS
PART OF A LARGER WORK, FILE A TICKET UNDER THE ISSUES TAB AND I WILL REMOVE THE
OFFENDING WORK. I harbor no ill intent and will honor any and all such requests.
All gathered works were sourced from armadafiles.com, unless created by the
FleetOps dev team.
