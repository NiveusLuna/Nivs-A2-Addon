# Nivs-A2-Addon
 NiveusLuna's Glorious Addon for Star Trek: Armada II Classic

As the name implies, this is an addon modpack. Not for A2, but for the FleetOps
mod "Star Trek: Armada 2 Classic". It is dependent on the FleetOps engine, and
is written for the 4.0 launcher. As the 4.0 launcher fixes several bugs in the
STA2 Classic addon to begin with, I recommend using it.

This mod contains both original work and mods made by others. I have not sought
permission for the mods made by others. This is because most were made over ten
years ago and contacting these people would be a royal pain in the ass. IF YOU
CREATED ONE OF THE INCLUDED MODS AND OBJECT TO MY REDISTRIBUTION THEREOF AS
PART OF A LARGER WORK, FILE A TICKET UNDER THE ISSUES TAB AND I WILL REMOVE THE
OFFENDING WORK. I harbor no ill intent and will honor any and all such requests.
All gathered works were sourced from armadafiles.com, unless created by the
FleetOps dev team.

ORIGINAL WORK BY FACTION

Borg
- Assimilation Nexus (button by Admiral Nat, passive weapons by FleetOps
  dev team)
- Assimilation Turret (idea from the A1 Alliances mod)
- Cannot decommission ships at shipyard and advanced shipyard
- Regeneration can be added to cubes by Technology Assimilator
- XML tech trees to allow Borg to build pods at the Technology Assimilator
	- I think this is a bug in the 4.0 launcher, so I made a workaround

Cardassians
- Cardassian Sensor Tap (Fly the Gul Vystan near an enemy station!)
- Scout and cargo ship autocloak 
- Orbital Starbase
	- Yes, it still mines metal
- Buffed repair speed
	- The faction tooltip says "above average," but it really doesn't differ
	from Fed/Kli/Rom values by a significant amount. So, I fixed that.

Klingons
- Cargo ship autocloak
- Orbital Starbase (This looks familiar)
- Commando Station
	- Look, I like stealing things, okay?

Romulans
- Scout ship autocloak
- Turret autocloak (with Cloak Enhancer research)
- Cargo ship automatic phase cloak (with Phase Cloak research)
- Orbital Starbase 
	- As you might have guessed by now, all Alpha Quadrant powers get one.

United Federation of Planets
- Sensor Turret and Starbase automatic Shield Enhancer (with research)
- Orbital Starbase

Non-8472
- Repair, scout, and colony ships default to G/H/H autonomy
- AI build list improvements
- Can build freighters from mining stations, two at a time
- Buttons for faster resource conversion
- Cloaks do not set ships to yellow alert (from red)

Universal
- Stations snap to a grid when placing them
	- This results in most stations taking up more space than normal.
